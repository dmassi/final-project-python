python 1051 - semester 1

The goal of the interactive online game "Guess the NFL Player" is to guess the name of an NFL player who is chosen at random from an image. Using pyScript to execute Python directly in the browser, the game has a straightforward Python and HTML framework. After seeing a picture of an NFL player, the player has to type the player's name into a text field. The game advances to the next player if their prediction is accurate; if not, it restarts.

I ran into a number of difficulties during the development process, especially when it came to managing Python code on the web browser. It was initially challenging to integrate Python directly into the homepage using pyScript because it was necessary to make sure that the HTML components and Python code interacted without any issues, being really difficult for me because I have never used HTML in my life or CSS even though I didnt implement it as much. I had to look up countless youtube videos, including the one you linked on canvas, to finally get familiar with using it. It also turned out to be more difficult than expected to manage the list of NFL players and their photos inside the project folder. I was using URLS at first to get the images, then decided it would be smarter to download images and use an image folder. I had to maintain the Python code's organization while making sure the images were appropriately titled and referenced in the HTML.

As someone who has always grew up watching the NFL, and still to this day is one of my favorite things, it made the project really enjoyable for me. Watching it work, even though the many errors and hardships, was probably one of the most satisfying moments of my college life so far. Creating something that I would actually play that is fun to me was the best, and I'm glad i used the skills from this Python class as well as skills I gained on my own time to accomplish this.
