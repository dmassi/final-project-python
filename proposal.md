# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Guessing The NFL Player

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A trivia type website that will show a picture of a random NFL player, which you must guess.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will have a list of NFL players, each with their own picture and name. The game will display a random NFL player with a picture of that person, and prompt the user to guess what the player's name is. The user will input their guess, and the goal of the program is to compare it to the correct answer. If the guess is correct, it will score a point and give a different player, and keep going until the guess is incorrect.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working website that gives an image of an NFL player that you must guess, and then keeps going until you don't get one correct.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Two modes, hard mode which is every NFL player and regular which is just NFL stars. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Website to look really nice, two modes like previously stated, and possibly another feature that will have the options of the players for you in a list as you type.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
