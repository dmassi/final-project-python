Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created the html layout, made a dictionary with around 75 NFL stars, imported random and randomized each image being shown and which NFL player it is. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Have to create a function to keep score after guessing the NFL player correctly

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Lots of problems, at first I tried to open images through a URL, and once I did this all the images would be different sizes and it was impossible to fix even after trying to center things with CSS. Then instead, I found a folder online with every NFL players face, and downloaded it to my computer with an image folder.
